# 🧠 Sports Insights ML

This repository contains personal projects focused on sports analytics and machine learning, covering both football (soccer) and NBA games. It includes data collection, preprocessing, and predictive modeling using Python.

## 📦 Projects Included

### ⚽ FUT - Football Match Predictor
- `FUT_Class.ipynb`: Handles feature engineering and training models to predict football match results.
- `FUT_Master.ipynb`: Orchestrates the complete prediction pipeline, from scraping match stats to generating final predictions.

### 🏀 NBA - Game Prediction & Data Generation
- `NBA_Data_Gen.ipynb`: Collects and processes NBA game statistics from external sources.
- `NBA_ML.ipynb`: Trains machine learning models to predict NBA match results based on advanced metrics like offensive rating, pace, and net rating.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- BeautifulSoup & Selenium (for scraping)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📊 Main Concepts
- Web scraping and data cleaning
- Feature engineering for sports data
- Multi-output prediction (e.g., predicting home and away scores)
- Time-weighted training to emphasize recent games
- Model evaluation for regression tasks

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This repository is under active development. Future improvements may include:
- Integration with live APIs (e.g., Understat, NBA stats)
- Real-time prediction interface
- Model explainability using SHAP or LIME
